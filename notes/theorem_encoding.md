### Theorems

- At least have a Diagram which contains the setting.
- Have a List of Prop's which contain the assumptions



- How are the conclusions encoded?
  - Could have a List\<Prop\> of conclusions as well. This would probably cover most of the cases, but it might miss out on a number of cases?
    - E.g. `affine(X)` implies there exists an `R : Ring` such that `X = Spec(R)`
    - How many use cases are there? If they are just of the form "something lies in the image of some functor", then maybe workarounds?
  - Have a Diagram on top of the Theorem, to which it is extended
    - But then how is the truthness of a Proposition such as `qcompact(X)` encoded?
    - Could identifications be made 'locally', i.e. from some diagram on?
  - A list of instructions?
    - Exists a ... 
    - Prop P is true ...





- Maybe first just do a list of conclusions, and then think about it later?
