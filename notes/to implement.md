### Priority

- Examples!
  - Context (data, no conditions), Conditional (data, conditions), Theorem (also conclusions)
  - Mapping : Context -> Diagram
  
  



### To Implement

- ~~A way to load files? `load schemes` or so.. / `import "filename"`~~
- ~~A efficient way to find mappings~~
- **How to deal nicely with composition of morphisms?**
- A way to create examples, and to search for examples
- ~~Take a look at the creation of new objects/morphisms. Apply some reduction rules, and try to descent (if a reference knows all the data as well, create the instance over there instead)~~

- ~~`Number +/&/=> Number` should just give another `Number`~~

- ~~Applying equalities.~~

- ~~A rule to shorten expressions like `etale(X, Y, f)` to just `etale(f)` ?~~
  - **Note:** it must be consistent then: either use `etale(X, Y, f)` everywhere, or use `etale(f)` everywhere (preferably the latter of course). Because otherwise it would be very hard to match two two if ever needed.
  - ~~A possibility is to use/allow a dash `_` in defining morphisms, e.g. `f : _ -> _â€‹`, and also REQUIRE that every object has at least one representation: then 'being the (co)domain' of `f` should also be a representation type, as well as 'is a proof'.~~
    - ~~But then how to specify the category of a morphism `_ -> _`~~
  - Solved by `use`, which creates implicit data



- How to prove `P => Q` statements, and how to prove `P | Q` statements?
  - Option 1: Make `Prover` a `Diagram`, where additional hypotheses can be made. Then `P => Q` can be proven by assuming `P` (i.e. creating another Prover on top of this, and try to prove P) over there.
  - Option 2: Heyting algebra approach



- ~~Have `Definitions` ? E.g. `etale(f)` is defined as `formally_etale(f) & locally_finite_presentation(f)`~~

- ~~`Definition` / aliasing | for `affine(X) <=> X = Spec(Ring(X))`~~
- ~~Property signatures, so that affine can hold for schemes and scheme morphisms~~
