## Examples

- Examples can be defined via `example name { use? ... let ... with ... }`
- Auto-deduce function that searches for (true) properties of the examples. Then we want these stored as 'snapshots' which can stored and used later!
  - Also store properties of Spec(Z) based on Z (and on Spec, etc.)
- 





### Search

Search starts using `search { use? ... let ... with ... }`.

Split the context into independent / disconnected parts.
